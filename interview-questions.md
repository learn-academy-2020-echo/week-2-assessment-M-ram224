# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer:
  - You would use the method super() in a the child component class to superintend the child component class data into the main .js class component.

  Researched answer: 
  - You would use the method Super() to call on the costructor of its parent class to access variables from the parent class.



2. What is a virtual DOM?

  Your answer: 
  - Virtual DOM is virtual DOMINION of all non-human beings living in the vast www that we call the internet! Honestly, I dont know, but my best guess would be Virtual DOM is the transfer of the data that is instantly transfered from code in react directly to the webpage. When we change or do something on the webpage the virtual DOM reacts with react changing it for the user.

  Researched answer:
  - Virtual DOM is associated with React elements, as they are the objects that represent the user interface. When React knows which virtual DOM has changed, then React updates only those objects in the real DOM.



3. When creating a basic (stateless) class component in React, what are the necessary elements needed to display "Hello World" in the browser?

  Your answer: 
  - So my best guess is these elements are what will create a working page, so I will need a component, inside this component you will need an import Name, class Name, Constructor(), render(), <div> <h1></h1> </div>, and an export.

  Researched answer: 
  - A Stateless class component is declared as a function that has no state and returns the same markup given the same props. It is just a plain javascript function which takes props as an argument and returns a react element



4. What is JSX?

  Your answer:
  - JSX is a JavaScript syntax

  Researched answer:
  - JSX is Javascript flavored html that is almost identical to html, except it uses className rather than just class, which is reserved for html.



5. What is state in React?

  Your answer: 
  - State in react is the process in which you can attach and change different elements by calling it as this.state

  Researched answer:
  - State is a built in object in React, you store property values in the state that belongs to the component and when the state object changes the component re-renders accordingly




6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  - Hoisting is the process how the elements get called into the webpage?

  Researched answer:
  - Hoisting is a default behavior in JavaScript of moving all declarations to the current scope or current script or current function



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React lifecycle methods
  There are three main phases in a react lifestyle that you can monitor and manipulate in each component, they are Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.
- React props
  React Props stands for "Properties", and can be taken as a single object argument with data and returns a react element.
- event.preventDefault()
  This method cancels an event in the native DOM to prevent a refresh on the browser page when submitting data.
- DOM events
  (Document Object Model) events in HTML are allowed JavaScript different event handlers on elements in the HTML document.They are actions that occur as a result of the state change of the elements of s DOM tree.
- MVC
  Stands for "Model, View, Controller", it seperates the application into these three components


  ### Side Note:
